  abstract={Single-photon emitters radiate as electric dipoles, which limits light collection efficiency and complicates integration into flat photonic devices. Developing nanophotonic structures capable of directing photon emission with tunable angular distributions in the visible spectrum has been pursued for applications ranging from integrated optical systems to discrimination of molecular species. To date, such directional control has been achieved using components whose overall footprint is larger than the emission wavelength and often rely on lossy plasmonic components. Here, we employ the DNA origami technique for deterministic nanoscale assembly, positioning single fluorophores in nanometric proximity to a single silicon spherical nanoparticle and demonstrate unidirectional emission with forward-to-backward intensity ratios up to ~7 dB. Furthermore, we show that a single silicon nanosphere antenna can function as a color router or a beam steerer depending on its size, emitter spectral range and emitter-nanoparticle distance.},

  title={3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors enabled by independent integration of optical pulling and lateral forces},
  author={Serrera, Guillermo and Tanaka, Yoshito Y. and Albella, Pablo},
  abstract={Light–matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.},

  title={Distance-Dependent Interaction between a Single Emitter and a Single Dielectric Nanoparticle Using DNA Origami},

  abstract={Optical nanoantennas can manipulate light–matter interactions at the nanoscale, modifying the emission properties of nearby single photon emitters. To date, most optical antennas are based on metallic nanostructures that exhibit unmatched performance in terms of electric field enhancement but suffer from substantial ohmic losses that limit their applications. To circumvent these limitations, there is a growing interest in alternative materials. In particular, high-refractive-index dielectrics have emerged as promising candidates, offering negligible ohmic losses, and supporting both electric and magnetic resonances in the visible and near-infrared range that can unlock novel effects. Currently, the few available studies on dielectric nanoantennas focus on ensemble measurements. Here, the DNA origami technique is exploited to study the interaction between silicon nanoparticles and organic fluorophores at the single-molecule level, in controlled geometries and at different spectral ranges within the visible spectrum. Their distance-dependent interaction is characterized in terms of fluorescence intensity and lifetime, revealing a significant modification of the decay rate together with minimal quenching and a high-fluorescence quantum yield even at short distances from the dielectric nanoparticle. This work demonstrates the advantages of dielectric nanoantennas over their metallic counterparts and paves the way for their applications in single-molecule spectroscopy and sensing.},

  title={Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces},
  author={Serrera, Guillermo and González-Colsa, Javier and Albella, Pablo},
  abstract={The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures that provide strong electric and magnetic field enhancements while preserving the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are ideal candidates for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation requires strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this work, we numerically propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 230-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator, which, when integrated with chiral media, enables an 800-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach toward ultrasensitive chiral sensing.},

  title={Enhanced optical chirality with directional emission of Surface Plasmon Polaritons for chiral sensing applications},
  author={Serrera, Guillermo and González-Colsa, Javier and Giannini, Vincenzo and Saiz, José María and Albella, Pablo},
  abstract={Chirality is a crucial aspect in life sciences, where systems capable of enhancing the chiroptical properties of molecules are highly demanded. In this work, we present a numerical proof of concept of a novel approach towards chiral sensing, consisting in the measurement of chiroptical properties via the directional emission of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on a metasurface. Based on the enhanced differential absorption between right and left circularly polarized light upon interaction with a metasurface made of high refractive index dielectric unit cells, a polarization-dependent SPP differential emission is obtained. Furthermore, the plasmonic emission direction is entirely dependent on the polarization handedness. Using FDTD numerical methods we report Circular Dichroism signals of around − 6° for the unit cell, with threefold dissymmetry factor enhancements in places accessible to analytes. We believe that this work sets a brand-new branch in chiral sensing towards faster, real-time measurements.},

  author={González-Colsa, Javier and Serrera, Guillermo and Saiz, José María and Ortiz, Dolores and González, Francisco and Bresme, Fernando and Moreno, Fernando and Albella, Pablo},
  abstract={Photoinduced hyperthermia is a cancer therapy technique that induces death to cancerous cells via heat generated by plasmonic nanoparticles. While previous studies have shown that some nanoparticles can be effective at killing cancer cells under certain conditions, there is still a necessity (or the need) to improve its heating efficiency. In this work, we perform a detailed theoretical study comparing the thermoplasmonic response of the most effective nanoparticle geometries up to now with a doughnut-shaped nanoparticle. We numerically demonstrate that the latter exhibits a superior tunable photothermal response in practical illumination conditions (unpolarized light). Furthermore, we show that nanoparticle heating in fluidic environments, i.e., nanoparticles undergoing Brownian rotations, strongly depends on the particle orientation with respect to the illumination source. We conclude that nanodoughnuts are the best nanoheaters in our set of structures, with an average temperature increment 40% higher than the second best nanoheater (nanodisk). Furthermore, nanodoughnuts feature a weak dependence on orientation, being therefore ideal candidates for photothermal therapy applications. Finally, we present a designing guide, covering a wide range of toroid designs, which can help on its experimental implementation.},

  abstract={Optical biosensing is currently an intensively active research area, with an increasing demand of highly selective, sensitivity-enhanced and low-cost devices where different plasmonic approaches have been developed. In this work we propose a tunable optimized grating-based gold metasurface that can act both as a high sensitivity sensor device (up to 1500 nm/RIU) and as an unidirectional plasmon source. The theory behind surface plasmon polariton generation is recalled to thoroughly understand the influence that every parameter of the grating source has on the performance of the proposed device. The results and conclusions discussed here offer a key step toward the design of biosensors based on excitation of surface plasmons polaritons by grating-based structures or in the process of creating new nanophotonic circuit devices.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
